# Multimodal-Single-Cell-Integration

## About:

Explored the Data of the Single cells in MultiModals. Multimodal single-cell data is increasingly available, data analysis methods are still scarce. Due to the small volume of a single cell, measurements are sparse and noisy. Differences in molecular sampling depths between cells (sequencing depth) and technical effects from handling cells in batches (batch effects) can often overwhelm biological differences. When analyzing multimodal data, one must account for different feature spaces, as well as shared and unique variation between modalities and between batches. Furthermore, current pipelines for single-cell data analysis treat cells as static snapshots, even when there is an underlying dynamical biological process. Accounting for temporal dynamics alongside state changes over time is an open challenge in single-cell data science. Single-Cell Analysis is an open-source problem.

## Workflow:

Generally, genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins. DNA must be accessible (ATAC data) to produce RNA (GEX data), and RNA in turn is used as a template to produce protein (ADT data).

## Prediction Task:

We can think of this Problem as having two parts: Multiome and CITEseq.
* For Multiome, we need to use transformed numerical DNA data to predict transformed numerical RNA data.
* For CITEseq, we need to use transformed numerical RNA data to predict transformed numerical Protein data
